;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides more intuitive fuzzy matching behavior for Helm.
;; Use in conjunction with the 'helm-flx' package for best results.
;; `helm-fuzzier' improves Helm's "matching", meaning that it tries
;; to ensure the best matches appear on the result list. 'helm-flx',
;; on the other hand, provides on-the-fly highlighting and (dramatically)
;; improves Helm's "scoring" so that the results are shown ordered from
;; "best" to "worst" match.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   (require 'helm-fuzzier)
;;   (helm-fuzzier-mode 1)
;;

;; The queries you currently use should continue to work reliably.
;; To take advantage of 'helm-fuzzier', queries should begin with the
;; same letter as the desired match and should form an abbreviation of
;; two or more word prefixes from the match.
;;
;; Query Examples:
;;
;; - 'emacs-lisp-mode' can be matched by 'el','em', 'elm', 'eli', 'elmo', etc'.
;; - 'helm-candidate-number-limit' can be matched by 'hcn','hnl', 'hecl', etc'.
;; - 'package-list-packages' can be matched by 'plp','plpa', 'paclp', etc'.
;;
;; Discussion:
;;
;; Helm's support (As of Oct 2015) for fuzzy matching breaks down when
;; the number of matches exceeds its internal limit
;; 'helm-candidate-number-limit'. Helm will stop looking once it finds
;; LIMIT matches, even if better matches exist among the remaining candidates.
;; The result is that the best matches are often not included in the results.

;; Helm additionally separates *matching* from *scoring* into separate
;; phases.  the former simply collects LIMIT matches of whatever
;; quality, the later sorts them from best to worst according to some
;; heuristic.

;; 'helm-fuzzier' augments helm's default *matching* phase with an
;; additional *preferred matching* phase which examines _all
;; candidates for matches that are likely to score highly in the
;; *scoring* phase, and makes sure they are included in the result
;; list presented to the user. Without this, the best results are
;; overlooked when there are lots of low-quality fuzzy matches, and
;; this failure occurs most often with short queries, exactly the case
;; users most care about (less keystrokes).

;; For preferred matching to produce good results there must be good
;; agreement between what it and what the *scoring* function consider
;; a "good match".  'helm-fuzzier' was written (and tested) for use
;; with the new 'helm-flx' package recently added to MELPA (by
;; @PythonNut), which enhances Helm's *scoring* phase by using
;; @lewang's 'flx' library.
